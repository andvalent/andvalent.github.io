I am a cloud engineer specializing in designing and building scalable, secure, and cost-effective infrastructure on AWS for startups and small businesses. My goal is to help businesses leverage the power of the cloud without the complexity.

## Services I Offer

*   **Serverless Solutions:** Building event-driven applications with AWS Lambda, API Gateway, and DynamoDB.
*   **Infrastructure as Code (IaC):** Automating infrastructure deployment and management using AWS CloudFormation and Terraform.
*   **CI/CD Pipelines:** Setting up automated build, test, and deployment pipelines using GitHub Actions or AWS CodePipeline.

## Portfolio Projects

Here are a few examples of solutions I can build.

### Project 1: Serverless API Backend

A complete backend for a web application built entirely on serverless technology, designed for high scalability and low operational cost.

*   **The Challenge:** A fictional startup needed an API that could handle unpredictable traffic spikes without over-provisioning expensive servers.
*   **My Solution:** I designed an API-driven, serverless architecture using API Gateway and Lambda.
*   **Technologies Used:** AWS Lambda, API Gateway, DynamoDB, Cognito, IAM.

### Project 2: Automated CI/CD Pipeline for a Web Application

This project showcases a fully automated pipeline that takes code from a GitHub repository, runs tests, and deploys it to a hosting environment.

*   **The Challenge:** A development team was losing time with manual deployments, leading to errors and slow release cycles.
*   **My Solution:** I implemented a CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions.
*   **Technologies Used:** GitHub Actions, Docker, AWS S3.
