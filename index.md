I am an **AWS Certified Solutions Architect** with a deep background in data science. My passion is helping startups and businesses build intelligent, scalable, and cost-effective cloud solutions. I bridge the gap between robust infrastructure and data-driven insights, ensuring your platform is not only secure and resilient but also optimized for performance and cost from day one.

My unique value comes from combining infrastructure-as-code best practices with a strategic understanding of data pipelines, machine learning workloads, and analytics.

## What I Can Do For You

*   **Cloud Cost Optimization & Strategy:** I design and review AWS architectures with a primary focus on cost-effectiveness. I help you forecast expenses, implement budget alerts, and right-size resources to ensure you only pay for what you need.
*   **Serverless & Event-Driven Solutions:** I build highly scalable, low-maintenance applications using AWS Lambda, API Gateway, DynamoDB, and other serverless technologies, perfect for APIs, data processing, and backend services.
*   **Infrastructure as Code (IaC):** I automate the deployment and management of your entire cloud environment using **Terraform** and **Amazon CDK**, ensuring consistency, repeatability, and eliminating manual errors.
*   **Data & Analytics Solutions on AWS:** Leveraging my data science background, I architect data pipelines using services like **AWS Glue**, **S3**, and **Athena** and design infrastructure to support **Machine Learning** workloads.
*   **CI/CD Automation:** I implement automated build, test, and deployment pipelines using **GitHub Actions** to accelerate your development cycle and improve release quality.

## Portfolio Projects

Here are a few examples of solutions I can build.

### Project 1: Serverless Data & AI Pipeline

An automated pipeline that ingests data from Reddit, enriches it with AI-generated summaries using Amazon Bedrock, and makes it available for analysis with SQL.

*   **The Challenge:** Businesses need to analyze public community discussions for market research, but manual methods are slow and unscalable.
*   **My Solution:** I designed an end-to-end, event-driven pipeline on AWS. It uses Lambda for ingestion, **Amazon Bedrock (AI)** for summarization, and Glue/Athena for analysis. The entire infrastructure is provisioned with **Terraform**.
*   **Technologies Used:** Terraform, AWS Lambda, Amazon Bedrock, S3, Glue, Athena.

### Project 2: Automated ECS Deployment for a Containerized API

A practical demonstration of deploying a containerized Python application on AWS ECS, with the entire infrastructure provisioned as code using the AWS CDK.

*   **The Challenge:** A common requirement is to deploy a containerized backend service to the cloud in a repeatable and automated fashion.
*   **My Solution:** I containerized a FastAPI application using **Docker** and wrote an **AWS CDK** script to automate the entire infrastructure deployment. The script provisions a VPC, an **ECS Cluster** (EC2 launch type), and a service to run the application container. The web UI is hosted on S3, demonstrating a decoupled architecture.
*   **Technologies Used:** Docker, AWS ECS, AWS CDK, FastAPI, S3.

### Project 3: Serverless Data Processing Pipeline (Example)

<!-- 
Suggestion: A data-focused project would be a perfect addition to showcase your dual expertise. 
You can use this as a template for a project you are building.
-->

A pipeline that automatically processes raw data files uploaded to S3, cleans them, and makes them available for analysis via SQL queries.

*   **The Challenge:** A business needed to analyze daily CSV reports, but the manual process of cleaning and loading them into a database was time-consuming.
*   **My Solution:** I built an event-driven pipeline where an S3 file upload triggers a Lambda function. The function uses Pandas to clean the data, converts it to a cost-effective format (Parquet), and stores it in another S3 bucket. AWS Glue Crawler catalogs the data, making it instantly queryable with Amazon Athena.
*   **Technologies Used:** AWS S3, Lambda, AWS Glue, Athena, Python (Pandas).
